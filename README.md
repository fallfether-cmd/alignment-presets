# alignment-presets
A folder containing images for alinging pattern in rhythm spell.

How to use:
- Go to code>>>download as zip
- In the rhythm spell editor, add a new block object.
- change the image to whatever you want to use for alingment.
- scale and rotate the image appropriately.
- disable the grid when using the images so that your key objects don't get re-snapped to the grid.

I recommend setting the creation time of the object to 0.0 beats, and an arbitrarily large duration time. Rhythm spell will render objects in the editor after they are removed for a little while, but you can't edit them during that period.

I would also recommend moving the alignment images you import to another layer so that they don't conflict with whatever objects you're aligning them with.
